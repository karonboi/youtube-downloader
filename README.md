Downloads YouTube videos using terminal

YouTube Downloader is an application written in Batch (i mean most of) that can download YouTube videos from Command Prompt. This version is only available for Windows now due to my lack of coding skills, sorry for that. There will be a version that supports other OSes like Mac, Linux, etc., but for now, let's just hang around with Windows.

Using youtube-dl alone, you still can download the videos but to convert them into a specific file type that you need is kinda a mess. Some websites also download YouTube videos and allow you to select different media files, which is a good point, but the quality is shit and the download speed is damn slow. Sometimes, the website just randomly redirects you to another website, most of them are football betting, or in the worst case, SEXUAL WEBSITES! and my dear god I am just 15 years old (when I wrote this), and now the internet just torturing me like that.

So, to fix the problems, I started researching how to download YouTube videos via Command Prompt. I then found out youtube-dl, and to solve the thirst for multi-extension, I decided to use it with FFmpeg, and a few codings on the interactions. Boom! That's how YouTube Downloader was born. Finally, I can avoid those toxic things.

YouTube Downloader uses youtube-dl by Ricardo Garcia for downloading the videos from the host and FFmpeg by Fabrice Bellard to compile and convert. Only I (karonboi) built the user interface. I also wrote a script called "Usage Warning". On the app, press E (either in capital or not) to view it, or simply read it here:
"Once you're started using 'YouTube Downloader", you agreed and promised that you will not download any copyright products (YouTube videos that are protected by specific licenses or laws). I respect your choices, but any copyright claims that are related to this application will be responded to by you (the user) and not by me. That also means you will have to take every punishment from the copyright owners. If you disagree with this Usage Warning, UN-INSTALL this application right now. If you try to do against the warnings, it's your fault."

This app is in development, and the first release (v1.0) is a test program, so of course, it has some limitations and bugs. If there are any issues during the use, feel free to report me on my GitHub account and if you have ideas to improve, don't hesitate to fork and edit this repository. Any big brains are welcome :)
